# Gomoku
This project implements the game with Applet in Java, and offers two modes - PvP and playing against the machine.

*Gomoku*, a.k.a. *Five in a Row / 五子棋*, is a traditional board game originated and popular in East Asia. Gomoku is played on a smaller version of Go board, containing 15 x 15 intersections. As the name suggests, one wins when his/her five pieces are aligned in one out of four directions. In the demonstration picture below, the player with black pieces wins.
